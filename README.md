Every year [Advent of code](https://adventofcode.com/) puts out a two part programming challenege for its advent calendar.  These are my attempts.  You can try challenges of previous years by adding "/2015" after the domain.

## Objective
To save Christmas, Santa needs you to collect fifty stars by December 25th. Two puzzles will be made available on each day in the Advent calendar; the second puzzle is unlocked when you complete the first. Each puzzle grants one star. Good luck!

## About my 2019 Attempt

I chose to do most of what I could in TypeScript / Node.  For every TS file there is a compiled JS file which Node will execute to run the program.  Compile in the terminal, run from the terminal.

    $ tsc file.ts
    $ node file.js

I image at some point I will switch over to Java to run the programs as well.  But I honestly hate reading from the file system in Java so meh...
