Every year [Advent of code](https://adventofcode.com/) puts out a two part programming challenege for its advent calendar.  These are my attempts.  You can try challenges of previous years by adding "/2015" after the domain.

# 2019 Background Story
Santa has become stranded at the edge of the Solar System while delivering presents to other planets! To accurately calculate his position in space, safely align his warp drive, and return to Earth in time to save Christmas, he needs you to bring him measurements from fifty stars.

Collect stars by solving puzzles. Two puzzles will be made available on each day in the Advent calendar; the second puzzle is unlocked when you complete the first. Each puzzle grants one star. Good luck!
