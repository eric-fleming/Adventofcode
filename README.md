## Objective
To save Christmas, Santa needs you to collect fifty stars by December 25th. Two puzzles will be made available on each day in the Advent calendar; the second puzzle is unlocked when you complete the first. Each puzzle grants one star. Good luck!

## About my 2019 Attempt

I chose to do most of what I could in TypeScript / Node.  For every TS file there is a compiled JS file which Node will execute to run the program.  Compile in the terminal, run from the terminal.

    $ tsc file.ts
    $ node file.js

There is a main() function at the bottom of each solution which decides whether to run each challenge, both, or neither if you are trying to test helper functions.

## Moving Forward
I image at some point I will switch over to Java to run the programs for performance.  I completed a concurrent programming class and I will be excited to see if I can write some concurrent code.  the one downside is I honestly hate reading from the file system in Java so meh...
