This year I am choosing to do as much of this challenge using The Go Programming Language as much as possible.

## Background Story
After saving Christmas five years in a row, you've decided to take a vacation at a nice resort on a tropical island. Surely, Christmas will go on without you.

The tropical island has its own currency and is entirely cash-only. The gold coins used there have a little picture of a starfish; the locals just call them stars. None of the currency exchanges seem to have heard of them, but somehow, you'll need to find fifty of these coins by the time you arrive so you can pay the deposit on your room.

To save your vacation, you need to get all fifty stars by December 25th.

## Go Specifics
To run the code for each day you need to build the Go executatble.  **[n]** represents the **number/day** that you care about.

```
$ cd day[n]
$ go build ./...
$ ./day[n]
```
